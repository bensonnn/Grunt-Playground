Grunt Playground
=========
This is a super-small boilerplate project for quick code testing.  It makes use of Grunt with livereload to make developing and testing dependencies simple and fast.


Firstly, install Grunt
```sh
npm install grunt
```

then start your server by running
```sh
grunt
```

Now you're good to go.

Running 
```sh
grunt install:[package name]
```
will automatically install any Bower dependency and load your dependency in to your index.html
